# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Geo-Search-App
This is a React Vite application for searching city data. The application includes a search box, a table to display results, and a pagination system to navigate through the data. Users can specify the number of cities to fetch from the server, with a default of 5 and a maximum of 10.

Features
Search Functionality: Search cities by name.
Debounced Search: Uses a custom useDebounce hook for efficient API calls.
Pagination: Navigate through paginated city data.
User Limit Input: Specify the number of cities to fetch per page.
Modular Components: Organized code with reusable components and hooks.
